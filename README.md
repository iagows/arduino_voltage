# Arduino AC Voltage to SD

Reads AC 220V and stores the data to SD card.

Data is stored in CSV format, which can be easily opened in Excel or other spreadsheet software.

Since it's a pure arduino + sd card + zmpt101b, without a real time clock, there's no timestamp, just how many seconds have passed since the arduino was turned on.
